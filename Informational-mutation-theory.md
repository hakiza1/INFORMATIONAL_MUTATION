**DIRECT PROOF TO THE "P=NP?...can NP hard reduce to NP complete or can NP COMPLETE reduce to P?"** (THE INFORMATIONAL-MUTATION VIA THE MONEY-MAKER-BOT or MMB empirically clarifying and proving P=NP is possible in any informational dynamically_orbital_system while reiterating P!=NP is undeniable in any informational statically_orbital_system, this is an informational version of a mechanical one: "THE UNIVERSAL MUTATION VIA THE ENERGY-MAKER-MACHINE or EMM empirically violating the conservation of energy and offering a fundamental direct proof to the Yang Mills existence and mass gap")











ABSTRACT


The present technology depicts new discovered fundamental laws of information (the universe in terms of "orbits = geometrically structured, compressed and gravitized-bits") from natural-chaotic-random-walk kind of binary systems (starting from simple natural coin flips to complex sophisticated natural financial market... and so forth); and how, despite their classical simplicity, they mathematically clarify and violate "INFORMATION (A.K.A energy) conservation principle". This technology arises from an exploration of how nature manages for information friction to coexist with the flow of information instead of suppressing each other (information friction, like mechanical friction, isn't just an impediment; it's essential for effective flow of information...Nature uses it to filter noise, stabilize systems, and enable specialized processing, ensuring that only relevant and robust information is acted upon, much like friction simultaneously allows for both motion and control of stability in physical systems; consequently ending up with the law of large numbers as the general globalizing law of all existing laws either already discovered or not yet discovered).
        
       
An experiment consisting of reversal or non-reversal sequences were constructed to enlighten the geometric structure arising from the simultaneous friction and flow of information in a given very complex financial market (can be any dynamically complex informational system provided with natural coin flips like-randomness obeying consequently and inevitably the law of large number)  that combines (in terms of information) two paradoxes of visible bodies in a rolling-sliding motion:
 - An equivalent in terms of information to the  Aristotle’s wheel paradox;
 - An equivalent in terms of information to the  The paradox of a circle that rolls on another stationary circle (the rotating coin paradox). 


And a such experiment did result in a constitution of an unbeatable trading bot "the HAKIZA-1i" (or the MMB) that generates consistent revenues unless there is a manipulation of data or a system failure that sometimes may occurs in any real world scenario (this is not the same theoretical bias that one may be accustomed to, anyone can get the generic bot from github and test it free of charge accordingly to the copyright  terms and conditions, run your own simulation or test it in real world and embrace the facts).
It challenges the Market Efficiency Hypothesis: The existence of a truly "unbeatable" trading bot that consistently generates "predictable, asymmetric gain" profoundly challenges the efficient-market hypothesis, which suggests that all available information is already reflected in asset prices, making consistent out-performance is impossible without inside information or illegal activities...what a myth! Anyway, it has been demystified.
Surprisingly, it ended up proving right both mathematically and physically some of Bernoulli's and Alembert's assumptions (regarding a loss likely to be followed by a win, vice versa) actually wrongly considered to be the gambler fallacy...Nevertheless, it has never been, it is not and it will never be a fallacy within an informational universe fundamentally and dynamically built on symmetries.  


As a matter of fact, it accidentally ends up proving the "EULER & GOLDBACH STRONG CONJECTURE" (Even number greater than two being the sum of two primes in Number Theory), the possibility of "P = NP" problem (NP-hard problems being impossible to solve according to Turing-Machine based computational logic in information theory) and fixing the "D'ALAMBERT STRATEGY" (being a trading or betting strategy in Financial-Market and game theories).
Hence, as its mechanical version, it enforces the homogeneity of the universe via the law of large numbers to finally clarify a scientific kind of taboo (both creation and loss of information A.K.A energy): 
"In any dynamically orbital system, the visible whole is created and lost within the invisible; it is a mutation (not just a simple flow of information or not just a simple transfer of physical quantities when it comes to mechanical systems) of which only the trigger of the movement decides its beginning, its magnitude and its end".

1. INTRODUCTION


New technologies relentlessly pursue the maximization of information flow efficiency, striving to minimize or even eliminate obstacles like information friction. Consider the relentless drive for faster data transfer, more efficient algorithms, or frictionless user interfaces.

Yet, despite these advancements, achieving truly zero information friction remains an elusive ideal. The digital and natural "cosmos" isn't an absolute void of information resistance. Instead, information systems are perpetually subject to informational friction.
These frictions manifests universally, stemming from the continuous interaction of information with the underlying computational or natural substrate. 
We see this in:

- A paradoxically methodical yet continuous processing delay in both vast natural and artificial complex data networks, akin to stars in their gravitational dance.

- A paradoxical impediment to achieving absolute informational stasis for elementary bits, preventing a truly "frozen" state of knowledge.

Unlike many computational scientists who, at our scale, have struggled to reproduce perfectly efficient, perpetual information processing kind of truly "unbeatable" trading bot, we prefer not to contradict the inherent nature of information by deeming it impossible. Instead, we aim to answer a counterintuitive question:

From the exact-sciences (computational) standpoint:

"How does nature manage for information friction to subsist alongside the flow of information while they were supposed to annihilate?"

Equivalent from a philosophical and social point of view to:

"Why something rather than nothing?"

The understanding of the question above leads to the discovery of a new discipline that deals with the notion of frictions and flow of information inseparable from any informational system in the visible and/or observable universe. It then redefines the current understanding of the notion of information (while clarifying  the most misunderstood and misused ever created concepts by human-beings = "the supposedly always increasing entropy and the so-called conservation principles") and its singularity, calling into question the anti-scientific supposed impossibility of perpetual information processing kind of truly "unbeatable" trading bot – a reality for which neither "classical nor quantum" computation-theories give much precision, but which nevertheless exists and unites them: "THE INFORMATIONAL MUTATION."






















2. OBSERVATION & HYPOTHESIS



N.B.: From an informational and computational standpoint, bear this in your mind because you're gonna need it to conclusively comprehend the whole rest of the present theory, an orbit is more than a structure of a "go_around and come_around" geometric trajectory; it is mainly an analogue to both mathematical and physical symmetry "(-) and (+) canceling to zero"; emphasizing a new gravitized definition of light being both mathematically and physically the most sensitive "perfect natural orbit (or symmetry)" due to its undeniably inevitable and unavoidable "two-ways-speed measurement".
The corpuscular effect is just a consequence from a presence of interaction by an "observer = receiver of light" disrupting the symmetry and causing light to behave like matter; and from an absence of interaction preserving the intactness of the symmetry in question then causing a signal like behavior of light"... So far this is what makes light the bridge between the visible and the invisible "read the UNIVERSAL MUTATION for more details".  

That said, out of simple curiosity, One may wonder: "how does informational-friction-flow manifests itself in real world?" 

To address such a question, let there be an informational system where  a scenario of "information friction shaping the flow of information" manifests itself over a given period of time (like a financial market "EUR-USD currency pair for instance", with trends and variations as usual caused by the paradoxical coexistence between frictions and the flow of information, can also be anything "like coin flips...random walk...etc" provided with natural randomness and consequently obeying the law of large number).

Within a such described above informational system, The "average number of non-reversal sequences = average number of reversal sequences" in a long term timeline; while in a short term, the "decreasing in non-reversal sequences = increasing in reversal sequences" vice-versa.

To comprehend the meaning of the last sentence above, let's visualize such a statement via the metatrader 5 using the HAKIZA_template (can be downloaded from github , being already an experienced MT5 user with at least a very little basic notion in programming may optionally help... if not, just follow the HAKIZA_template user-guide for Personal-computers and Smart-phones)... note that for both Personal-computers and Smart-phones, image of the "orbitally or symmetrically geometrized structure of information" globally looks as discontinued zigzags or zagzigs within the sub-window of the MT5:

        https://youtu.be/Uqp1kYJLbIM
          
 
 
REMINDER: 

Might not be obvious at first sight, but this is about mathematically geometrizing arthimetic into further gravitized informational physics.
Worth to mention that some basics (especially the notions of convergence and infinite set in Calculus, Set theory, and Number Theory) share a common  root optionally needed to easily comprehend the present theory:

 (Numbers → Geometric Structures → Physical Laws → Information Patterns).





Let's provide an informational interpretation to the MT5 provided with the HAKIZA template: 



> The meaning of Time-frame (1 min chart) and colors :

- Zigzags or Zagzigs in the MT5 sub-window are drown From the closing of the previous 1 min candlestick to the closing of the current 1 min candlestick (offering 100% precision and 100% accuracy to differentiate varying market from trending market).
- Market (red_candle; green_candle) can be any binary system akin to coin (tail; head), to boolean (no; yes), to spin (up; down), ..., to bit (0; 1) .




> Since we have 100% precision and accuracy, the logic from the MT5 will be used to comprehend the rest of this theory from now on and consequentially:

- For varying market (consecutive "either starting with red or green" candlesticks and continues with alternation of the two colors = reversal sequences):
If the market provides us with neither a red_candle nor a green_candle, it means the market didn't move in either direction but it is the end of the sequence (special case); therefore the color of the current candlestick  is the same as its previous candlestick color (without omitting anything, it just simplifies while clarifying any kind of ambiguity in decision making for a further computation topic of this same theory).
   
- For trending market (consecutive "either starting with red or green" candlesticks and continues without alternation of the two colors = non-reversal sequences):
If the market provides us with neither red_candle nor green_candle, it means the market didn't move in either direction but it is the end of the sequence (special case); therefore the color of the current candlestick  is the opposite of its previous candlestick color (without omitting anything, it just simplifies  while clarifying any kind of ambiguity in decision making for a further computation topic of this same theory).  

==> One can even capitalize on the special cases above when it comes to real trading by using CALLE or PUTE (meaning respectively "more than or equal to" and "less than or equal to" for binary options on trading platforms like DERIV).




>The Zigzags or zagzigs represent the reversal sequences (varying market) while free space disconnecting them represent non-reversal sequences (trending market). In order to simplify calculations , since we are talking about the paradoxical coexistence of friction and the flow of information despite their natural attempt to suppress each other, let just focus on the very same scenario by mostly analyzing the fluctuating part of the market based on "reversal sequences" (although the geometric linkage between two different isolated non-reversals sequences differs from the geometric linkage between two different isolated reversal sequences, still their distributions have almost the same properties, so understanding any of them consequentially reflect and  clarifies what will be generally happening on the other side... "the geometric linkage in question will further be discussed and developed during the experimentation part of this same theory "):


- For reversal Sequences starting with green_candle (N.B.: Zigs or zags don't flip whatsoever; each of them starts exactly at the closing of the previous candle and will never react to the market until the exact end of the closing of a current candle duration... the only way for a reversal sequence to react to the market is either by stopping or continuing to grow in number of "zigs and zags" consequentially the only way for a non-reversal sequence to react to the market is either by continuing with the free space or by stopping due to the appearance of a new zig or a zag): 
 
(1). An isolated  zig sequence: /  means the market must reverse only once before trending (red> green green).
(2). An isolated zigzag sequence: /\ means the market must reverse in a consecutive way twice before trending (red> green red red).
(3). An isolated zigzagzig sequence: /\/ means the market must reverse in a consecutive way three times before trending (red> green red green green).
   .
   .
   .
(n). An isolated n zigzag sequence: /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/...\ means the market must reverse in a consecutive way n times before trending.


Consequentially, non-reversal sequences starting with green_candle go as follows:

(1).  (green> green red) means the bullish market must trend only once (during a one candle duration) before reversing
(2).  (green> green green red) means the bullish market must trend twice (during a duration of two consecutive candles) before reversing
(3).  (green> green green green red) means the bullish market must trend three times (during a duration of three consecutive candles) before reversing
   .
   .
   .
(n).  (green green green green...green red) means the bullish market must trend n times (during a duration of n consecutive candles) before reversing



- For reversal Sequences starting with red_candle (N.B.: Zigs or zags don't flip whatsoever; each of them starts exactly at the closing of the previous candle and will never react to the market until the exact end of the closing of a current candle duration... the only way for a reversal sequence to react to the market is either by stopping or continuing to grow in number of "zigs and zags" consequentially the only way for a non-reversal sequence to react to the market is either by continuing with the free space or by stopping due to the appearance of a new zig or a zag): 

(1). An isolated  zag sequence: \  means the market must reverse only once before trending (green> red red).
(2). An isolated zagzig sequence: \/ means the market must reverse in a consecutive way twice before trending (green> red green green).
(3). An isolated zagzigzag sequence: \/\ means the market must reverse in a consecutive way three times before trending (green> red green red red).
   .
   .
   .
(n). An isolated  zagzig sequence: \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\.../ means the market must reverse in a consecutive way n times before trending.



Consequentially, non-reversal sequences starting with red_candle go as follows:

(1).  (red> red green) means the bearish market must trend only once (during a one candle duration) before reversing
(2).  (red> red red green) means the bearish market must trend twice (during a duration of two consecutive candles) before reversing
(3).  (red> red red red green) means the bearish market must trend three times (during a duration of three consecutive candles) before reversing
   .
   .
   .
(n).  (red> red red red...red green) means the bearish market must trend n times (during a duration of n consecutive candles) before reversing





> Warning 1: 
 

- Pay attention in this other special case where the "isolated reversal sequences in MT5 do continue or end while they were supposed to do the opposite"; it is just a vision illusion caused by the market discrepancy (it is all about the closing of the previous candlestick not being aligned with the opening of the current candle; so encountering such a scenario is correctly normal since the logic only focuses on the closing of both the previous and current candles).   




> Warning 2:  


- Each sequence is very deterministic depending on what corresponding colors one chooses it to predict, although one can know exactly when each zig or zag begins and ends accordingly to the time-frames, still one can never choose neither the beginning nor the end of a given sequence comprising consecutive zigs and zags (this basic logic applies for both reversal and non-reversal sequences, it also still apply at any step of the sequence in question..."it doesn't matter wether it is the forth wether the eleventh zig or zag"):

E.g.1: Normally / means  (red> green green), so if one chooses it to predict green color then financially in any known binary trading system, it is a win that can be represented as "/+"; but since the sequence may continue and become /\ or /\/ or any other long sequence; in that case, it is a loss that can be represented as "/-\..." .

E.g.2: Although / normally means  (red> green green), one may still choose it to predict red color then financially in any known binary trading system, it is a loss can be represented as "/-"; but since the sequence may continue and become /\ or /\/ or any other long sequence; in that case, it is a win that can be represented as "/+\..." .

E.g.3: Normally \ means  (green> red red), so if one chooses it to predict green color then financially in any known binary trading system, it is a loss can be represented as "\-"; but since the sequence may continue and become \/ or \/\ or any other long sequence; in that case, it is a win that can be represented as "\+/..." .

E.g.4: Although \ normally means  (green> red red), one may still choose it to predict red color then financially in any known binary trading system, it is a win can be represented as "\+"; but since the sequence may continue and become \/ or \/\ or any other long sequence; in that case, it is a loss that can be represented as "\-/..." .

In other words, this is a combination of determinism and non-determinism, where one can beforehand be 100% deterministic about the results for any given isolated  sequence while staying partially non-deterministic to a given extent when it comes to the continuation of the length growth for that same sequence in question (within this same theory, it will be further proven that "more the sequence grows, more its continuation becomes deterministic").   

 


> Analysis:


Out of simple curiosity, One may still wonder: "what does information-energy-equivalence even mean?" 
        
To remedy the question above, let’s imagine and assume we are somehow dealing with physical like system where we have "input power and output power" but actually in terms of information (to allow anyone with basic notion in "physics & math" to understand how "information & energy" mirror each other and are effectively the same thing):


        (Let's conceptually suppose the Metatrader5's chart represents a flow of a given fluid or might even be the flow of electricity and so on...)
     
      
Anyway, pay a little bite of your attention out here, while sticking with the fluid logic for simplicity:
       
- Each step "of reversal or non-reversal" in a given isolated sequence has a property that we name an "INFORMATIONAL PARTIAL POTENTIAL" denoted "IPP" (It can be "zero = neither a loss nor a win" or take any real value "negative = a loss" or  "positive = a win"; kin to A MINIMAL OR MAXIMAL VALUE OF A POTENTIAL-DIFFERENCE FOR A GIVEN FLOW OF A FLUID).

- Each  isolated sequence has a property that we name an "INFORMATIONAL FINAL POTENTIAL" denoted "IFP" (It is a total sum of all "informational partial potentials IPP"). 
 
- Each  reversal or non-reversal sequence has a property that we name an "INFORMATIONAL UNIT PERIOD" denoted "ST" (it is a time-frame duration; a duration of any "zig or zag" within any isolated sequence; kin to THE TIME DURATION UNIT USED IN A DESCRIPTION OF THE FLOW RATE OF A GIVEN FLUID).

- Each  reversal or non-reversal sequence has a property that we name an "INFORMATIONAL PERIOD" denoted "T" (it is the exact total sum of "informational unit periods ST" for any whole given isolated sequence; in other words, it is just the time duration of any isolated sequence as a whole).

- Each set of "either specifically non-reversal sequences or specifically reversal sequences" starting "either with red-candle or with green-candle" has a property that we name an "INFORMATIONAL TOTAL PERIOD"; it is denoted "TT for reversals sequences"; while it is denoted "NTT for non-reversal sequences" (It is a total sum duration of "all informational period T" for a specific set of isolated sequences in question; in other words, it is a total time duration for either a set of specifically non-reversal sequences or specifically reversal sequences).
      
- The combined both two sets of isolated reversal and non-reversal sequences, starting "either with red-candle or with green-candle" has a property that we name a "INFORMATIONAL TIME-DURATION" denoted "TD" (It is a total sum duration of "all informational periods T" for all isolated sequences in a given set of both non-reversal and reversal sequences in question).      
      
- Each isolated sequence has a property that we name an "INFORMATIONAL INTENSITY" denoted "II(T)" (it is a frequency of occurrence, the average number of isolated sequences with a given specific "informational period T" that can occur during a given time duration; kin to A FLUID FLOW RATE). 

- Each  isolated sequence has a property that we name a "STARTING INFORMATIONAL INTENSITY WITH T = 1" denoted "II(1) " (the average number of isolated sequences specifically with  "T = 1 meaning a single isolated zig or zag" that can occur during a given time duration).




N.B.: 

- The naming of the above cited properties apart from being a new invention, they are the keys to understand the rest of this present theory.

- Before tackling the below development, bear in your mind that we are dealing in terms of information and we don't need units of measurement.

- The notion of infinite series is a key for more accuracy in determining the above cited properties.








* Let there be a statically-continuous  informational system (a system that uses continuously the same informational partial potential) with the 1 min chart of the EUR-USD currency pair during 1 month in MT5 (it means 1440 min for a time-duration of 24 hours ==> in other words, it is just an average of 720 min for non-reversal sequences and 720 min for reversal sequences each 24 hours ==> in other words, it is also just an average of 360 min for non-reversal sequences starting with red_candle accompanied with  with an average of 360 min for non-reversal sequences starting with green_candle each 24 hours;  and an average of 360 min for reversal sequences starting with red_candle accompanied with an average of 360 min for reversal sequences starting with green_candle each 24 hours).
In a such informational system, the informational properties for each set either of reversal or non-reversal sequences (in other words, the convergence to given average numbers of different isolated sequences that occur over 24 hours with their corresponding informational potentials and time durations) can be represented as follows :


-For reversal Sequences starting with green_candle (it doesn't matter either one starts with "+" or "-", let optionally assume any last zig / or zag \ of a given sequence looses):  

Period T    II(T)          Symbol & IPP                IFP          Sequence                                         

 1          90               /-1                       -1           (red> green green).                               

 2          45               /+1\-1                     0           (red> green red red)                              

 3          22.5             /+1\+1/-1                 +1           (red> green red green green)                         
 .          .                  .                        .                .                                                      
 .          .                  .                        .                .                                                      
 .          .                  .                        .                .                                                     
 
 n         [90/2^(n-1)]      /+1\+1/+1...\-1 or /-1  +(n - 2)      (red> green red green red...red red or green green)    




=> TOTAL Period "TT" = 2 * 360min =  2 * [(90 * 1min) + (45 * 2min) + (22.5 * 3min) + ... + {[90/2^(n-1)] * (n)min}]  if "n is infinitely large"
=> Time-duration "TD" = 24h = (4 * 360)min
=> For both reversal sequences with just one zig or one zag  and their consequential non-reversal sequences, the starting informational intensity:
 "II(1) = TT/8ST = NTT/8ST = 2 * 360min/(8 * 1min) = 90"
 
If we neglect all inefficiencies (might be broker's fees and so forth...) then assume all positive informational final potentials "IFP" and their corresponding informational intensities "II" lead to an output or win informational power "ouP = (IFP * II)" kin to an output fluid flow power (can physically be compared to any other form of apparent power);  and all negative informational final potentials "IFP" and their corresponding informational intensities lead to an input or loss informational power "inP = (IFP * II)" kin to an input fluid flow power (can be compared to any other form of apparent power); we end up with something like this:


IFP = ({(45 * 0) + (22.5 * 1) + (11.25 * 2) + (5.625 * 3) + ... + [(n - 2) * 90/2^(n-1)]}) - (90 * 1) = 0 ; which means an orbit "A.K.A symmetry" is  statically achieved.
 
 
=> ouP = {(45 * 0) + (22.5 * 1) + (11.25 * 2) + (5.625 * 3) + ... + [(n - 2) * 90/2^(n-1)]}  
       = 90
 
=> inP = [90 * (1)]
       = 90 

=> ouP = inP ; which means that "an involvement of the time duration (4 * 360)min at each side" ends up with a kind of conserved informational work kin to physical work (can be compared to any other form of energy... and the same logic applies to non-reversal sequences).  


Consequentially, non-reversal sequences starting with green_candle basically go as follows:
 1     90                (green> green red).
 2     45                (green> green green red).
 3     22.5              (green> green green green red).
 .      .
 .      .
 .      .
 n    [90/2^(n-1)]      (green> green green green...green red)


=> TOTAL Period "NTT" = 2 * 360min =  2 * [(90 * 1min) + (45 * 2min) + (22.5 * 3min) + ... + {[90/2^(n-1)] * (n)min}]  if "n is infinitely large"

=> ouP = inP







-For reversal Sequences starting with red_candle (it doesn't matter either one starts with "+" or "-", let just optionally assume any last zag \ or zig / of a given sequence wins):

=> Time-duration "TD" = 24h = (4 * 360)min

Generally speaking:



> FIRST AXIOM

In any informational system "kin to a natural random walk style...coin flips...financial market... etc" consequently obeying the law of large numbers in a considerable enough amount of time, for each specific set of either isolated reversal or non-reversal sequences, the informational total period "TT" of each specific set is in average always the half of the whole time-duration "TD" of the combined both two sets of isolated reversal and non-reversal sequences, as follows:

==> TT = NTT = TD/2 
==> TD = TT + NTT





> SECOND AXIOM

In any informational system "kin to a natural random walk style...coin flips...financial market... etc" consequently obeying the law of large numbers in a considerable enough amount of time, for reversal sequences with just one zig or one zag and their corresponding consequential non-reversal sequences, the starting Informational intensity noted "II(1) or II(T=1) for specifically isolated single either zig or zag sequences of specific set of either reversal or non-reversal sequences of an informational period T=1" is always an average frequency of occurrences that is equivalent to the 1/8 of the informational total period "TT or NTT" of a specific set of either non-reversals sequences or reversal sequences, as follows:

==> II(1) = TT/8ST = NTT/8ST ;  where ST is just a unit time-frame duration for each zig or zag (like the candlestick time-frame).






> THIRD AXIOM

In any informational system "kin to a natural random walk style...coin flips...financial market... etc" consequently obeying the law of large numbers in a considerable enough amount of time, for reversal sequences with just one zig or one zag and their corresponding consequential non-reversal sequences, the starting Informational intensity noted "II(1) or II(T=1) for specifically isolated single either zig or zag sequences of specific set of either reversal or non-reversal sequences of an informational period T=1" is always an average frequency of occurrences that is equivalent to the 1/16 of the whole time-duration "TD", as follows:

==> II(1) = TD/16ST ; where ST is just a unit time-frame duration for each zig or zag (like the candlestick time-frame).






# Note:

In any informational system "kin to a natural random walk style...coin flips...financial market... etc" consequently obeying the law of large numbers in a considerable enough amount of time, no matter the chosen progression in terms of winning and loosing, as long as the informational partial potential is statical or semi-statical, the input informational power is always equal to the output informational power, It is all about being in a informational statically orbital (or symmetrical) informational system:

==> inP = ouP; consequently there is a conservation of information A.K.A Energy, therefore whenever we are dealing with informational statically-orbital-systems, it is still  fair to talk about a simple flow of information or a simple transfer of physical quantities when it comes to mechanical systems .


==> Whenever the informational final potential "IFP = 0" for either a given isolated sequence or a set of isolated sequences, it just means a formation of an orbit "A.K.A symmetry" is  statically achieved and the law of large numbers is undeniably obeyed.

Generally speaking:


> FIRST HYPOTHESIS

From an informational standpoint, a Circle Rolling on Another Circle can be equated to a finite steps of a (simple or reverse) martingale (can be any martingale like style "D'Alambert, Oscar grind... and so forth"; which is all about being aggressive in timing to achieve an orbit)  always coming with a (one more or one less) unit after each completed orbit." This implies a predictable, asymmetric either gain or loss over repeated cycles.
The input or loss informational power "inP" is never equal to the output or win informational power "ouP" (it either shrinks or dilates since a finite steps of a "simple or reverse" martingale always comes with a "either one more or one less" unit after each completed orbit), this appeals to the notion of imaginary time; it is all about dynamically orbital (symmetrical) either informational or mechanical systems (see the HAKIZA-1 "UNIVERSAL MUTATION).


> SECOND HYPOTHESIS

From an informational standpoint, an Aristotle's Wheel Paradox can be equated to the self-similarity (fractal nature) of financial instruments or currencies across different time-frames (5min charts, 1min charts, and so on... as long as the instrument in question is provided with pure randomness).
Two different charts ("with different time-frames but of the same financial instrument or currencies provided with pure randomness") exhibit same properties on any given huge or near infinite timeline (the self-similarity is confirmed in different time-frames of a same financial instrument where going from like a 1min chart to 5min or any other value is like zooming in or out the Mandelbrot involving at some extent the notions of logarithmic-spirals and power-laws, the distribution behavior of reversal or non-reversal sequences remain the same in the long run, in other words financial data exhibits fractal-like properties across different time-frames), this appeals to the notion of informational singularity; it is all about the inseparable and continuous friction_flow of information kin to the unceasing motion for mechanical systems (see the HAKIZA1 "UNIVERSAL MUTATION").





# Note:

In any informational system "kin to a natural random walk style...coin flips...financial market... etc" consequently obeying the law of large numbers in a considerable enough amount of time, depending on the chosen progression in terms of winning and loosing, as long as the informational partial potential is methodically and infinitely dynamical, the input informational power is always different from the output informational power, It is all about being in a dynamically orbital (or symmetrical = "finite orbit") informational system:

==> inP != ouP; consequentially there is no a conservation of information A.K.A Energy, therefore it is from now on fair to talk about a mutational flow of information rather than a simple flow of information "kin to the mechanical mutational transmission within the HAKIZA-1 Energy-maker-machine or EMM".

==> Whenever the informational final potential "IFP != 0" for either a given isolated sequence or a set of isolated sequences, it just means a formation of an orbit "A.K.A symmetry" is  dynamically achieved  or is still ongoing for the law of large numbers to be undeniably obeyed.





















3. EXPERIMENTATION & PROTOTYPES & RESULTS


# The experiment of double orbital-informational friction

There is a condition of existence for the double orbital-informational friction for the "MMB = money-maker-bot" kin to the condition of existence for the double orbital-mechanical friction of the "EMM = energy-maker-machine". And that condition is about the ratio from consecutive zig and zag (wether it is within a set of isolated sequence or not; wether it is within the same sequence or not; the same logic does apply separately for both non-reversal and reversal sequences) being always different from 1 in order to infinitely rend dynamic the informational system in question (it just means progressive adjustment with "martingale like style which is the same thing as the D'Alambert with just less aggressive timing").


There are two HAKIZA-METHOD and both of them take advantage of short orbits:

- By identifying rare geometric structures coming with those short orbits in question (that's for the aggressive method using a naturally-bounded-simple-martingale like style).

- By reusing previous gains from a very controlled huge amount of natural direct short orbits to force shortening the "loosing or negative very small side but fatal one" of any possible long orbit which therefore strengthens its winning or positive side  due  to a resulting broken symmetry (that's for the passive method using D'Alambert of "85.71428...8571428"% natural direct short orbits against  "7.142857...7142857"% of loosing or negative side of any possible long orbit while cementing "7.142857...7142857"% of the other winning or positive side of any same possible long orbit).
















* The aggressive HAKIZA-METHOD is mostly for a new kind of algorithmic trading purpose named "MUTATIONAL TRADING" (can not be specifically used for computation due to its most important requirement of "reaching very higher thresholds" causing only occasional rare occurrence of events; although the actual method is very flexible when it comes to taking some precautions "kind of hit and run like style behavior" in order to mitigate most of possible "kind of sophisticated arbitrage" from brokers, still the taken precautions don't act as a bullet proof and very easy to detect with necked eyes "kind of arbitrage behaviors that might or might not be suable in court" will be thrown out by brokers trying at any cost to fail the actual unbeatable natural_law_based_trading_method).




> Warning:

Normally, any random use of the "martingale like style... D'Alambert... etc" doesn't work in real world because one always ends up encountering a long enough non-achieved orbit to drain the initial portfolio, this is the main problem which is being addressed by this aggressive method "by naturally and geometrically identifying those longest possible orbits and raise up the threshold to where one naturally and geometrically expect them to become short orbits".  
Turns out most people don't realize it at first sight, each doubling enforces a formation of an orbit at each step of the martingale progression starting from the second step (that's where it gets its aggressive nature). 
 
N.B.: One must take into consideration some additional fees from brokers when it comes to trading (a small scale factor in real world might be needed, like "multiplying by 2.1 instead of just doubling").



 
> Analysis:

Out of simple curiosity, One may still wonder: "what does an informational-mutation-structure even mean?" 

To remedy the question above, let's imagine a combination of the previously discussed "FIRST and SECOND HYPOTHESIS" (to allow anyone with basic notion in "physics & math" to understand how an "informational-mutation-structure" comes into existence):

If one pays a little bit of attention, then there will be a realization of the following:

- There is an exponential decay when it comes to the distribution of informational intensities "IIs" while their corresponding informational periods "Ts" grow in a polynomial manner.
In other words, more a length of a given either reversal or non-reversal sequence grows, more the occurrence of that sequence in question becomes rare to even happen in real world (happening once within a very monumental time-duration that mostly doesn't worth it  for a human-being to afford or handle). 


If one still pay a little bite of attention, then there will be a realization of an unbeatable combination involving "the two already cited hypothesis to take advantage of the naturally undeniable fundamental exponential decay" as follows:

- A self-similarity behavior across different time-frames (especially by zooming  within those very short time-frames "in terms of ticks", the law of large number "in the occurrence of different isolated sequences" start to manifest itself) .
The more a length of a given either reversal or non-reversal sequence grows (when it comes to ticks), the more the occurrence of that sequence in question; although still rare (since the probability of occurrence didn't change), it becomes possible to happen few times within a time duration that human-beings can afford or handle (N.B.: one shouldn't confuse probability and possibility). 

- An always ending sequence with period "T or TT" between practically at most 21 to 27 in real world when it comes to few ticks kind of short time-frames (going beyond 27 is unlikely gonna happen for mostly any coin_flips_like_style_informational_system which by the way mimics probably the whole universe in terms of bits of information, but if it does and does it frequently "then it mostly signals either a non-coin_flips_like_style_informational_system or a violation of data integrity", one can run his own simulation with trillions of ticks forming red candle_stick kin to tail and green candle_stick kin to head mimicking financial markets... And then count the longest sequence of consecutive reversals or non-reversals... And finally embrace the facts), which then means that if a martingale trading style is introduced at the right time "it is going to very effectively be self-bounding due to that natural stop".  


That said, when it comes to like 1 min chart for EUR-USD,the period "T or TT" is between practically at most 14 to 21 in real world... Hence, it does generally worth mentioning that an informational-mutation-structure is just a geometric pattern born out of the exponential decay that manifests itself via an occurrence of  a rare given long sequence (it is either a long geometric pattern of just one isolated long sequence; it can also be a set of combined isolated short and long sequences that form just one rare interlinked long geometric pattern) for which a probability for the continuation is exponentially decaying and where starting from an elevated threshold means "few steps of a simple martingale are enough to trade against that continuation".




> Description:

An informational-mutation-structure is mostly all about the pattern always ending up being broken no matter how long it might get (there is always a known practical limit range in real world... may differ from one informational system to another and therefore must better be determined via  simulation and confirmed experimentally for each specific informational system due to the fact that the level of randomness may vary from one system to another)"...To be more clear, the geometric pattern in question must contain a very short and predictable orbit to worth the nomination among "informational-mutation-structures" (as in the mechanical version, one can talk about mutation if and only if there is an emergence from nowhere "the invisible = information in imaginary time"  into somewhere "the visible = information in real time").

All of those examples are very effectively already tested using python scripts developed basically for very short time-frames (1 to 10 ticks) suitable for synthetics options on platforms like deriv. 
And they turned out to be very simple and efficient in practical real world (within the  «HAKIZA-1i-basic and HAKIZA-1i-lite, see the below prototype section with github link», the e.g1  and e.g2 are used for instance in informational INGOMA2 and any of their consequential non-reversal sequences are applied for instance in informational INGOMA1; within the «HAKIZA-1i-lite, see the prototype section with github link»,e.g3 is used for instance in informational INGOMA4 and any of its consequential non-reversal sequences is used for instance in informational INGOMA3;  e.g4 is used for instance in informational INGOMA12 and any of its consequential non-reversal sequences is deployed for instance in informational INGOMA11). 



That said, there are lot of other very effectively efficient patterns even though their number is practically finite (theoretically infinite...Anyway), one may still wonder how to choose and find a new geometric pattern with enough requirements to be considered as an informational-mutation-structure:

==> it is all about choosing a given either one long sequence or a set of  sequences (with either the same repeating isolated sequence or different isolated sequences)... and then trigger a martingale style trade from a preferable already tested threshold against the continuation of the occurrence of either that long sequence or that set of sequences in question; which therefore suppresses the need of infinite time and resources (from the combination of the already mentioned hypothesis, the MMB « money-maker-bot » kin to the EMM « energy-maker-machine » were built and both mutationally violate the conservation of information A.k.A energy in a perpetual way).
 


Here are few more examples of geometric patterns that are formed from set of sequences (same rules apply when it comes to their consequential non-reversal sequences):

⁃ Set of a same repeating sequence :

/\  /\  /\   /\ /\  /\    /\   /    or    /\  /\  /\   /\ /\  /\    /\   /\/...

The geometric pattern from a set of a same isolated sequence /\ breaks with / or /\/...



⁃ Set of a same repeating sequence:

\/  \/ \/    \/ \/    \/  \/ \      or       \/  \/ \/    \/ \/    \/  \/ \/\... 
  
The geometric pattern from a set of a same isolated sequence \/ breaks with \   or \/\...



⁃ Set of different repeating sequences :

\/\  /  \/\ /    \/\ / \/\  /\...         or      \/\  /  \/\ /    \/\ / \/\/...

The geometric pattern from a set of two different isolated  sequences / and  \/\ breaks with /\... or \/\/...



⁃ Set of different repeating sequences :

/\/  \     /\/ \ /\/ \  /\/  \/...       or      /\/  \     /\/ \ /\/ \  /\/\...

The geometric pattern from a set of two different isolated sequences  /  and \/\ breaks with \/...or /\/\...





> FIRST THEOREM

In any informational system "kin to a natural random walk style...coin flips...financial market... etc" consequently obeying the law of large numbers in a considerable enough amount of time, for reversal sequences and their corresponding consequential non-reversal sequences, those with period "T = n" occur approximately "half as often as" those with period "T = n–1"; which means that for any else informational intensity rather than the the starting Informational intensity "II(1) where T = 1", "II(n) where T = n"  is always determined as follows:

==> II(n) = [II(1)/2^(n-1)]

 
 
 
# Note:

In few words, the non-determinism around the geometric continuation of a given isolated sequence exponentially decreases with the polynomial_growth of the informational_period of that same sequence in question.

==> More a mutational pattern geometrically grows in space_time, more deterministic it becomes...Therefore more predictable its future is...oh...but wait (where is entropy? gone...No, just an illusion in a short term...in the long run, It has just even never been there ... That's due to the necessity of that mentioned exponential decay being the foundation of both the undeniably inevitable-unavoidable law of large numbers and the principle of least action... run your own test and embrace the facts).








# prototype and results 


The actual MMB is not a get-rich-over-night kind of unrealistic delusional bot, it is a natural_law_based_proof_of_concept designed with simplicity for educational purpose and redundancy for precision; aiming to help with easier logging-debugging for both:
- Educators "to consider and teach the notion of super-determinism".
- And regulatory entities "to finally expose some retail Brokers' illegal behaviors".
- Professional traders "to refine , adapt and make consistent gains in long term from traditional brokers". 

        
        https://github.com/hakiza1/PROOF_OF_CONCEPT   (you're not trading price... You're trading the geometry of time) 
        
        https://youtu.be/oUzwFR7AxYY   (This is symmetry hunting... Then asymmetry harvesting)
        
        

Depending on the available initial portfolio, one can lower the threshold to even 1, sure for test.
But bear in your mind that "increasing the threshold means a decrease of trades per day and a small initial portfolio to withstand decreased martingale steps, very safe and recommended"; on contrary, "decreasing the threshold means an increase of trades per day and a huge initial portfolio to withstand increased martingale steps, less safe and not recommended" (that is the reason why the MMB isn't a get-rich-overnight).



Those pieces of code from those links above are basically enough for any simulator... but when it comes to testing in real, they are  just some proofs of concept that still need further additional lines of codes:

- Either for further improvement in order to test evading possible arbitrage behaviors when it comes especially to retail brokers. 
Believe it or not "most if not all of retail brokers are just bunch of professional cheaters (just like any casino, the house never loses, You must be paranoiac enough more than they think they are in order to take a risk of making some money out of their platforms). 


- Or for refinement and recalibration in "threshold, time-frames, assets, fix APIs, ticks processing, non binary-options... and so forth" to adapt the MMB to acknowledged very harshly regulated traditional brokers (this is for financial institutions and professional traders with enough initial resources who wanna make a fortune or already making a fortune out of trading with very slowly progressive wins).

        (script kept private... still undergoing a patent process... anyway, any crazy individual can still come up with an own refined code)
 
        
        
        
 
 
N.B.: INTUMVA ZAMAHO, NDASUBIYEMWO (USED TO SAY THE 9th PRESIDENT OF BURUNDI "PETER NKURUNZIZA")...FOR ANY STUBBORN, I'M GONNA REPEAT THIS AGAIN "The MMB IS NOT A GET_RICH_OVER_NIGHT-BOT"; still it is practically and theoretically unbeatable wether one likes it or not, as long as there is data integrity and no technical failure (Only a refined MMB-pro for traditional brokers is worth its name, Deriv-demo is like a real world scenario testing playground).















* The passive HAKIZA-METHOD is mostly for  a new kind of computation purpose named "MUTATIONAL COMPUTATION" (can be used in trading but its most important requirement of "zero-interruption in data flow and 100% data integrity" would be near impossible to achieve in real world trading conditions where interruptions can even be intentionally  and mostly provoked for arbitrage purpose by the same brokers claiming to be guardians of integrity, which finally will rend the method somehow less efficient; but since it can be suitably used with both short and large time-frames, professional traders can still give it a try on very regulated brokers).



> Warning:

Normally, any random use of the "martingale like style... D'Alambert... etc" doesn't work in real world because one always ends up encountering a long enough non-achieved orbit to drain the initial portfolio; for once again, this is the main problem which is being addressed by this passive method "by naturally and geometrically identifying and capitalizing in a very controlled way on a huge number of short possible orbits to naturally and geometrically defy and shorten any possible long orbit that may occur so far" (unexpectedly leading us to P=NP problem and a mutational computation). 

Turns out most people do realize it at first sight, it sometimes takes a little bite too long  and too many steps of the D'Alambert progression in order to form an orbit (that's where it gets its passive nature, despite that fact, it still all about achieving an orbit same as the martingale style). 


> Analysis:

Out of simple curiosity, One may wonder: "what do informational-mutation-solvability and informational-mutation-verifiability even mean?" 

To remedy the question above, let's dive deeper in the geometrized friction_flow of information (to allow anyone with basic notion in "physics & math" to understand how an "informational-mutation-structure" can still come into existence not just for a given isolated long sequence or  a given set of  isolated sequences but for a considered as a whole single sequence of information):


- The passive method is indeed about considering the whole flow of information  "for all  reversal sequences" as a one single informational-mutation-structure (where the informational total period "TT" from the reversal sequences proportionally appeals to the time_determinism...kin to the deterministic polynomial time for a Turing problem_verifying process; while the informational total period "NTT" from their consequential non-reversal sequences appeals to the time_non_determinism...kin to the non-deterministic polynomial time for a Turing problem_solving process). 

To achieve such a single informational-mutation-structure, for simplicity and flexibility, let’s geometrically consider the set of all isolated reversal sequences and  geometrically ignore the isolated non-reversal ones (note that the contribution of an informational total period "NTT" from consequential isolated non-reversal sequences in order to determine the informational time-duration "TD" can never be ignored... and therefore non-reversal sequences are still playing a data-integrity key role for a complete interpretation of the friction-flow of information considered as a whole single sequence of information):




e.g.: 

==> If both reversal and non-reversal isolated sequences are combined, there might practically  be a bunch of isolated reversal sequences of information

... \/\/\/\/\/\/\  /  \ / \/\/    \/\/\   /\  /\/  \    / \   /\   /\/\/\/\/    \/   \/\ ...

... /\/  \  / \ /\    /\/   \/\/\/\/\/  \/\  /    \ /   \/   \/\    /\   /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ ...


==> If isolated non-reversal sequences are theoretically ignored, the isolated reversal sequences become an imaginary single sequence of information

...\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\...

.../\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/...


As any one must notice, if non-reversal sequences are ignored, the disconnected isolated reversal sequences end up forming a single infinite zigzag or zagzig sequence.



As already mentioned in the very beginning of this work "let actually tackle the geometric linkage between isolated reversal sequences resulting in a single geometric structure and find out if the later can also be considered as mutational (shortened-predictable-orbit  to worth the nomination of being an informational-mutation-structure)" by just Compressing and regrouping all sequences into three groups:

                
                       (THE HAKIZA-COMPRESSION)
                

⁃ Sequences with an informational period T = 1  (a single isolated reversal sequence with an informational period "T = odd natural Number equivalent to 1", and an informational intensity noted "II(1)")
   
    e.g.:   / and \

⁃ Sequences with an informational period T = 2 (a double isolated reversal sequence representing any other sequence with an informational period "T = even natural number", and an informational intensity noted "II(2)")
   
    e.g.:   /\ and \/

⁃ Sequences with an informational period T = 3 (a triple isolated reversal sequence representing any other sequence with an informational period "T = odd natural number strictly greater than 1", and an informational intensity noted "II(3)")
   
    e.g.:   /\/ and \/\
    

One may be fairly wondering: what the hell is going on ?...! 

Never forget that although the continuation of a given isolated sequence is at some extent non-deterministic in short term, still the informational partial potential "IPP" and total informational potential "IFP" of each isolated sequence are always known and set beforehand to meet one’s choice.



Let's address the above intrigue with what we dub the HAKIZA-PROGRESSION for the below given growing sequences (your attention is actually more than needed to comprehend such a progression): 


                      ( THE HAKIZA-PROGRESSION )
                                                 

• If one optionally set any single (T=1) isolated reversal sequence starting with green-candle / to a loss (-) , it means the informational final potential "IFP"= IPP = -1;  and the one starting with red-candle  \ to a win (+), it means the informational final potential "IFP"= IPP = +1 .

/-   and   \+


• If the later sequences keep growing (that means the last zig /- was a win /+\ and  last zag \ was a loss \-/) , let's now strictly set any double (T=2) isolated reversal sequence starting with green-candle /\ to end with a loss (-) , which means the informational final potential "IFP"= +1-1 = 0; and the one starting with red-candle \/ to end with a win (+), which means the informational final potential "IFP"= -1+1 = 0 .

/+\-   and   \-/+


• If the later sequences keep growing (that means the last zag /+\- was a win /+\+/ and last zig \-/+ was a loss \-/-\) , let's now strictly set any triple (T=3) isolated reversal sequence starting with green-candle /\/ to end with a win (+), which means the informational final potential "IFP"= +1+1+1 = +3; and the one starting with red-candle \/\ to end with a loss (-), which means the informational final potential "IFP"= -1-1-1 = -3 .

/+\+/+    and     \-/-\-


• If the later sequences keep growing (that means the last zig /+\+/+ was a loss /+\+/-\ and last zag \-/-\ was a win \-/-\+/) , let's now strictly set any (T=4) isolated reversal sequence starting with green-candle /\/\ to end with a loss (-), which means the informational final potential "IFP"= +1+1-1-1 = 0; and the one starting with red-candle \/\/ to end with a win (+), which means the informational final potential "IFP"= -1-1+1+1 = 0 .

/+\+/-\+/+    and     \-/-\+/-\-


• If the later sequences keep growing (that means the last zig /+\+/-\+/+ was a loss /+\+/-\+/-\ and last zag \-/-\+/-\- was a win \-/-\+/-\+/) , let's now strictly set any (T=6) isolated reversal sequence starting with green-candle /\/\/\ to end with a loss (-),  which means the informational final potential "IFP"= +1+1-1+1-1-1 = 0; and the one starting with red-candle \/\/\/ to end with a win (+), which means the informational final potential "IFP"= -1-1+1-1+1+1 =0.

• If the later sequences keep growing (that means the last zag /+\+/-\+/-\- was a win /+\+/-\+/-\+/ and last zig \-/-\+/-\+/+ was a loss \-/-\+/-\+/-\) , let's now strictly set any (T=7) isolated reversal sequence starting with green-candle /\/\/\/ to end with a win (+),  which means the informational final potential "IFP"= +1+1-1+1-1+1+1 = +3; and the one starting with red-candle \/\/\/\ to end with a loss (-), which means the informational final potential              "IFP"= -1-1+1-1+1-1-1 = -3.

• If the later sequences keep growing, any (T = n odd natural number greater than 1) isolated reversal sequence starting with green-candle /\/\/\/\.../ set to end with a win (+),  it statically means its informational final potential "IFP"= +3 ; and any (T = n odd natural number greater than 1) isolated reversal sequence starting with red-candle \/\/\/\/...\ set to end with a loss (-), it statically means its informational final potential "IFP"= -3.

=== Hence any (T = n odd number greater than 1) isolated reversal sequence, no matter how long it might get, it still can be represented by Sequences   (/\/ and \/\ )   with an informational period "T = 3+2A" and an informational intensity noted "II(3)" .
Where "A belongs to {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...}" and represents the number of pairs [(+); (-)] within a given isolated reversal sequence.
    


• If the later sequences keep growing, any (T = n even number) isolated reversal sequence starting with green-candle /\/\/\/\.../\ set to end with a loss (-), it statically means its informational final potential "IFP"= 0; and any (T = n even number) isolated reversal sequence starting with red-candle      \/\/\/\/...\/ set to end with a win (+), it statically means its informational final potential "IFP"= 0.

Any even-length reversal sequence can be decomposed into paired signed prime units.

Let's break down the example with Even sequence below (can be applied to any isolated either reversal or non-reversal even sequence):


\/\/\/\/\/\/\/    (length or informational period T=14, even)

After applying the HAKIZA-PROGRESSION scaling, we end up with:

\-/-      \+/-    \+/-    \+/-    \+/-      \+/-    \+/+
Group as pairs of (±):

\-/- = -1 -1 = -2

\+/- = +1 -1 = 0

\+/- = +1 -1 = 0

\+/- = +1 -1 = 0

\+/- = +1 -1 = 0

\+/- = +1 -1 = 0

\+/+ = +1 +1 = +2

Sum = (-2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + (+2) = 0 

Key Insight:
The only non-zero contributions come from the first and last pairs:

First pair: \-/- = -2

Last pair: \+/+ = +2

All middle pairs sum to 0.

So the even sequence results in an informational final potential  "IFP = (2) - (2) = 0"; which is a zero-sum of two primes.

Even sequence = sequence of paired ± units where first and last are opposite-signed primes, middle are neutral.


ONE MAY NOT REALIZE IT TOO QUICKLY, BUT IF A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION IS PAID, THIS IS A GEOMETRIC DEMONSTRATION OF THE EULER-GOLDBACH CONJECTURE
 
(Let's finally claim a geometric demonstration:"each even number greater than two represents an orbit obtained from a zero-sum of two primes +2-2=0"); 
(Let's finally reiterate and reaffirm the strong Conjecture to be true:"each even number greater than two is a sum of two primes").   CQ
                                                                                                                                              
           
 






==> Finally all isolated reversal sequences can now be compressed and regrouped into three groups (/ and \; /\and \/; /\/ and \/\ ), which makes easy the study of their distribution and the geometric linkage between them (We dub it the HAKIZA-COMPRESSION).

e.g.:

Set of reversal sequences before compression

... \/\/\/\/\/\/\  /  \ / \/\/    \/\/\   /\  /\/  \    / \   /\   /\/\/\/\/    \/   \/\ ...

... /\/  \  / \ /\    /\/   \/\/\/\/\/  \/\  /    \ /   \/   \/\    /\   /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ ...
    
    

Imaginary representation of same above set after compression (N.B.: I used the term imaginary representation where A pairs within long sequences are geometrically ignored for faster logic processing; but practically A pairs must still be logically and arithmetically considered):

... \/\  /  \ / \/    \/\   /\  /\/  \    / \   /\   /\/    \/   \/\ ...

... /\/  \  / \ /\    /\/   \/  \/\  /    \ /   \/   \/\    /\   /\/ ...



Imaginary representation of same above set of reversals without non-reversals (N.B.:  although considered as a single whole infinite sequence; I used the term imaginary representation where non-reversals sequences are geometrically ignored just for faster logic processing; but practically their informational total period NTT must still be logically and arithmetically considered):

... \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ ...

... /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ ...







Notice:


- If one pays much more attention, there is an obvious realization of reversal sequences not being  randomly geometrically linked to each other.
Nature makes sure a single infinite reversal sequence can always be achieved by enforcing this condition: "if the previous isolated reversal sequence ends with a zig /... that means the current or next isolated reversal sequence must start with its opposite zag \... vice versa".
It therefore opens a door for a possible predictability (super-determinism) which may then lead to the consideration of the single long infinite sequence being an informational-mutation-structure. 

For instance:

- An isolated reversal sequence /\ can never be immediately followed by an isolated reversal sequence \/ ;
- An isolated reversal sequence /\/ can never be immediately followed by an isolated reversal sequence /\/ ;
- An isolated reversal sequence \/\ can never be immediately followed by an isolated reversal sequence \/\ ;
- An isolated reversal sequence / can never be immediately followed by an isolated reversal sequence / ;
- An isolated reversal sequence \ can never be immediately followed by an isolated reversal sequence \ .  




- Consequentially, there comes a little difference between reversal and non-reversal sequences (if one decides to ignore isolated reversal sequences instead of ignoring isolated non-reversal sequences, there will be an obvious illusion for compressed non-reversal sequences appearing to be randomly geometrically linked to each other... but the reality is:  "they can geometrically still be indirectly linked  the same way as  isolated reversal sequences if additional conditions are added"... that's due to  the fact that the distributions  in terms of  informational intensities are interdependently the same for both reversal and non-reversal sequences... therefore focusing on isolated reversal sequences is more appealing, flexible, and does still reflect their consequential non-reversal sequences as long as we are in presence of "a random walk or a fair coin flips" kind of system).





> Description:  

Let's consider an informational system with optionally the 1min chart of the EUR-USD currency pair during optionally enough time like 1 month in MT5 (it means 1440min for a time-duration of 24hours ==> in other words, it is just an average of 720 min for non-reversal sequences and 720 min for reversal sequences each 24hours ==> in other words, it is also just an average of 360min for non-reversal sequences starting with red_candle accompanied with  with an average of 360min for non-reversal sequences starting with green_candle each 24hours;  and an average of 360min for reversal sequences starting with red_candle accompanied with an average of 360min for reversal sequences starting with green_candle each 24hours).

In a such informational system, the informational properties for each set of reversal sequences (in other words, the convergence to given average numbers of different isolated sequences that occur over 24 hours with their time durations) can actually be generally represented as follows:

In the long run, there is always a necessarily unshakable natural symmetry not only between informational intensities (frequency of occurrence) of isolated reversal sequences starting with a green-candle and those starting with red-candles but also between informational total periods "TT" for all reversal sequences and "NTT" for all their consequential non-reversal sequences; to kill it all... "there is a symmetry between odd and even number sequences  which goes like this (N.B.: The notion of infinite series is a key to understand the HAKIZA-COMPRESSION):

                     ==> The total time-duration TD = (720 + 720) ; meaning 1440 min or 24hours of total time-duration for a time-frame "ST = 1min"




Since the geometric linkage between zig and zag  sequences are not random, we must find the fundamental theorems that govern the formation of a considered as a whole infinite single reversal sequence, which then obliges us to question the "so-called gambler fallacy" and find out if the assumptions from BERNOULLI and ALAMBRRT are actually true or not (optionally, either each loss "/-" is likely to be followed by a win "\+"... or  each win " /+" is likely to be followed by a loss "\-", vice-versa):

- In order to check what those assumptions are about, let geometrically gravitize  the notion of information via only three compressed kind of isolated reversal sequences  to represent the whole friction-flow of information by introducing in the equation the informational potential (as already proved early in this theory, whenever the informational final potential "IFP = 0" for either a given sequence or a set of sequences, it just means a formation of an orbit "A.K.A symmetry" is  statically achieved).

/   \  and  \    / (with informational period "T = 1" and non-deterministic informational total period for non-reversal sequences "NTT", optionally can form an orbit :  /-      \+   and  \+    /-    or   \-    /+  and  /+   \- )  representing all reversal sequences basically with an informational period "TT = 1 * 2" and an informational final potential "IFP = 0" .

/\ and  \/ (with informational period "T = even number" and without informational total period for non-reversal sequences "NTT", strictly can form an orbit:   /+\- and  \-/+  or  /-\+ and  \+/- ) representing all remaining reversal sequences basically with an  informational period "TT = even number" and an informational final potential "IFP = 0".

/\/    \/\  and  \/\  /\/  (with informational period "T = odd number greater than 1" and non-deterministic informational total period for non-reversal sequences "NTT", optionally can form an orbit: /+\+/+   \-/-\-  and   \-/-\-   /+\+/+    or   /-\-/-    \+/+\+  and  \+/+\+    /-\-/-) representing all remaining reversal sequences basically with an informational period "TT = (First odd number greater than 1) + (second odd number greater than 1)" and an informational final potential "IFP = 0".


- Geometrically gravitizing  the notion of information is after all about determinism in informational total  period "TT" (arising from already known three types of compressed isolated  reversal sequences with already known informational period "T", which makes the informational total  period "TT" deterministic beforehand and proportionally kin to a polynomial time needed to verify any already  given solved problem) against  non-determinism in time-duration "TD" (arising from the ignored isolated non-reversal sequences whose, although ignored,  their informational total period "NTT" can't be suppressed when it comes to contributing on  the whole time-duration longevity to form an orbit kin to a non-deterministic polynomial time needed for a given problem-solving process in real world).

- Any sequence with an odd-counted period followed by a sequence with the unequal odd-counted period, both signal the starting of a possible long orbit.









> SECOND THEOREM

In any informational system "kin to a natural random walk style...coin flips...financial market... etc" consequently obeying the law of large numbers in a considerable enough amount of time, the geometric linkage "between compressed isolated reversal sequences [ /or\; /\or\/; /\/or\/\ ] representing the whole friction-flow of information" always obeys an average deviation around the number 7 as follows:

==> The 4/7 average deviation for [ /\/ \ and /\/ \/and /\/ \/\ ]  or  [ \/\ / and \/\ /\and \/\ /\/ ];   

It means 4 out of 7 isolated reversal sequences  for any given  reversal sequence among [/or\; /\or\/; /\/or\/\] are geometrically directly-linked to a triple reversal sequence [ /\/ or \/\ ].

==> The 3/7 average deviation for [ /\/ \  / and /\/ \ /\and /\/ \ /\/  ]  or  [ \/\ /  \ and  \/\ / \/and \/\ / \/\ ]; 

It means 3 out of 7 isolated reversal sequences  for any given reversal sequence among [/or\; /\or\/; /\/or\/\] are geometrically indirectly-linked via an isolated single reversal sequence "/ or \"  to a triple  reversal sequence [ /\/ or \/\ ].








> THIRD THEOREM

In any informational system "kin to a natural random walk style...coin flips...financial market... etc" consequently obeying the law of large numbers in a considerable enough amount of time, the geometric linkage "between compressed isolated reversal sequences [ /or\; /\or\/; /\/or\/\ ] representing the whole friction-flow of information" always obeys orbits formation with an average deviation around the number 7 as follows:


==> The 6/7 average deviation for [ /\and  \/;  /    \   and   \    /;  /\/   \/\   and   \/\  /\/ ]

It means 6 out of 7 isolated reversal sequences, in other words 85.71428...85714285% globally form directly-linked orbits (this is an average total sum of Hyper-directly-linked orbits, super-directly-linked orbits and directly-linked orbits) .


==> The 1/7 average deviation for   [ /\/  \  /\/...\/\  /  \/\ and \/\  /  \/\ ... /\/  \  /\/ ]

It means 1 out of 7 isolated reversal sequences, in other words 14.2857142...8571428% globally form indirectly-linked orbits (this is an average total sum of indirectly-linked orbits).

 






# Note:


Out of simple curiosity, One may have already wondered... How come a deck of cards is 52  and once shuffled 7 times it reaches a so-said kind of pure randomness? 

The deviation around 7 "which is the most optimized number of times needed to shuffle and achieve a so-said kind of pure randomness from a deck of 52 cards" isn't just a coincidence due to the actual provided fact that (e.g.: within the 1 min chart EUR-USD currency pair MT5 for instance) "3/7 meaning 12.85714...2857142 out of 30" for isolated reversal sequences with an informational period "T = 3"  nears 52 once combined  with " the 1/7 meaning 12.85714...2857142 out of 90" for isolated reversal sequences with an informational period "T = 1" (to finally form either the negative or positive side of the indirectly-linked possible long orbits):

==> 52 equals almost to (12.8571428...8571428 * 3) + 12.8571428...8571428 = 51.428571...8571428  out of 720 (the small noticed difference is about the nonsense of having a half card leading to 52 cards); the later is equivalent to the "7.142857...85714285% of all reversals representing the loosing or negative very small side but fatal one" of any possible long orbit, playing against 617.1428571...8571428 out of 720 equivalent to "85.71428...8571428% of all reversals representing the natural direct short orbits" cementing the 51.428571...8571428  out of 720 equivalent to "7.142857...85714285% of all reversals representing the other winning or positive side of any same possible long orbit" (Note that this decimal part 857142 keeps infinitely repeating).                                                                                                     
 



THEREFORE BOTH BERNOUILLI AND ALAMBERT ASSUMPTION WERE MATHEMATICALLY AND PHYSICALLY CORRECT ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T PROVE IT

(Let's finally claim that "any imaginary single infinite long sequence is a possible informational-mutation-structure");
(Let's finally reiterate and reaffirm that 85.71428...8571428% of the cases: "Any win is to be followed by a loss, vice versa" ).  CQFD
                                                                                                                                           
















==> Thanks to the law of large numbers and the principle of least action, everything gets where it supposes to be, the both inevitable and unavoidable orbit (or symmetry) formation with the so-called increasing passage of time (I'm personally convinced, human-beings' minds are the ones passing; time is just mutating from "imaginary=rotation" to "real=translation", vice versa)  can always dynamically lead to an emergence of a "only_Yes_containing_informational_system"... oh... but wait (where is entropy? gone...no, just a theoretical special case within short terms or small-scale structures of randomness... Where is conservation? gone...no, just another theoretical special case for statical-systems which by the way don't exist in real practical world as we know it).





Any well-thinking-being may still be like: "okay... what the hell is going on?" ... The trick is that most of the Clay_institution said millennium problems are somehow profoundly linked; which means addressing one of them may potentially lead to addressing some of the rest...since I've already mentioned the natural deviation around the number 7, any mad mathematician is already beyond any doubt thinking about prime numbers, the Markov chain reaction within atomic and nuclear bombs and so forth...the reality is "I've personally already started to address fundamentally the RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS at this very moment writing down this theory" (One may not realize it... but despite the simplicity of the actual theory, it still is the fundamental tool to finalize the job "the zeros of the zeta function are all hyper-directly-linked orbits"... the RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS is further discussed and addressed with more complex mathematical notions not mentioned in this present shortened theory). 







# Consequences:


Since the geometric linkage between compressed isolated sequences is obviously cleared, let's tackle the consequences within a dynamically informational system where the informational partial potential "IPP" can keep systematically, methodically and infinitely changing.

As in the aggressive method, the passive method is also founded on the previously discussed FIRST HYPOTHESIS (for the informational system to be dynamic via D'Alambert strategy) and on the SECOND HYPOTHESIS (for the informational system to contain enough different isolated reversal sequences appealing to the law of large numbers)...So, one still need such a combination (to allow anyone with basic notion in "physics & math" to understand how to create and take advantage of a single infinite "informational-mutation-structure" ).


And since it is already well understood how orbits (or symmetries) between zig and zag  sequences form within an infinite single reversal sequence;  there comes a demystification and a practical confirmation to the BERNOULLI AND ALAMBRRT  assumptions "wrongly assumed to be the gambler fallacy" (for instance, optionally either each loss "/-3" is likely to be followed by a win "\+4"... or  can be each win " /+4" is likely to be followed by a loss "\-3") :


- And as already mentioned,it is all about geometrically gravitizing  the notion of information via only three compressed kind of isolated reversal sequences  to represent the whole flow of information in a compressed way(by making sure  whenever a formation of an orbit "A.K.A symmetry" is dynamically achieved, the informational final potential "IFP > 0" for either a given sequence or a set of sequences).

Taking too long to form an orbit and practically ending up draining the initial portfolio; this is technically known as the impossible infinite amount of time and resources when it comes to trading; if the said issues are not addressed, it ends up with an informational final potential "mathematically IFP <= 0 and physically IFP = 0"  after an imaginary geometric linkage for an non-achieved orbit mainly caused by the below described fatal symmetry-disbalance:

This is traditionally known as "the long winning streak" occurring before any loosing streak ever happens… Instead of being a come-back, it becomes a set-back since the dynamical system becomes both theoretically and practically semi-statical or statical... ending up causing a further symmetry-disbalance which will certainly be fatal despite the unshakable effectiveness of the law of large numbers; this might technically be addressed at some extent by the modular D'ALAMBERT  when it comes to trading as shown above with 3 as a module... but at the end of the day it still fails and ends up with a kind of NP hard problem... and this is the main issue being addressed by the actual method; if the issue is not addressed in the long run, it comes with an informational final potential  "mathematically IFP <= 0 and physically IFP = 0"  after an imaginary geometric linkage for a further non-achievable orbit caused by the symmetry-disbalance… AND FINALLY CAUSING AN IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE N P HARD-PROBLEM.

==>To remedy the above harsh conditions, now comes into play THE DOUBLE-HAKIZA-STRATEGY (CAN OPTIONALLY BE COMBINED WITH AN INTENTIONAL FAVORABLE SYMMETRY-DISBALANCE) to make the single infinite sequence an undeniable informational-mutation-structure:                                         
                                          




                                          
• The DOUBLE-HAKIZA-STRATEGY  (TO SUPPRESS THE FATAL SYMMETRY-DISBALANCE) 


> Let's first describe the flaw (the hitting of a mathematical wall) within the Modular_D'Alambert_Strategy:

e.g1: If the Module = 9  with less than 9 steps, it would seem to be theoretically profitable (with the mathematical wall not yet hit).

... +9  +8  +7  +6  +5  +4  +3  +2 ... -1  -2  -3  -4  -5  -6  -7  -8 ...      --->    (IFP = +8) > 0
                         
===> For instance, there is no any symmetrical disbalance; and with the inevitable law of large numbers necessarily allowing a formation of orbits, the Modular_D'Alambert_Strategy may seem unbeatable even if it is not.


e.g2: If the Module = 9  but with equal or more than 9 steps, it wouldn't theoretically be profitable (with the mathematical wall already hit).

... +9  +8  +7  +6  +5  +4  +3  +2  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1... -1  -2  -3  -4  -5  -6  -7  -8  -9  -10  -11  -12  -13 ...    --->    (IFP = -42) < 0
                                    ------------------     
===> For instance, those five underlined consecutive wins creates a further symmetrical disbalance; and despite the inevitable law of large numbers necessarily allowing a formation of orbits, such a disbalance may cause a  further impossible come-back ending with an IFP < 0. 



> Let's now use the DOUBLE_HAKIZA_STRATEGY to fix the above flaw (the solution to the hitting of a mathematical wall), as described below:


- Definition 

The Double_Hakiza_Strategy is a hedging-strategy placing simultaneously two trades in opposite directions ending up forming two sets of informational  partial potentials "IPP"; where one of the set is statical while the other is dynamical (possibly interchanging that role whenever they both reach the informational partial potential "IPP" equaling to a unit).    


   ... +9  +8  +7  +6  +5  +4  +3  +2  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1 ... -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -2  -3  -4  -5  -6  -7  -8 ...        --->    (IFP = +8) > 0
                                       ===---------------                         ===                                        
   ... -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -2  -3  -4  -5 ... +6  +5  +4  +3  +2  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1 ...        --->    (IFP = +8) > 0 
                                       ===                                        ===
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           ---> (IFP = +16) > 0                                    
                                    
===> For instance, those five underlined consecutive wins will never create any kind of symmetry-disbalance (they will instead be suppressed); and with the inevitable  and unavoidable law of large numbers necessarily enforcing a formation of orbits, such a hedging_strategy always assures a come-back ending up with an IFP > 0. 
 
  
           
BY USING THE DOUBLE_HAKIZA_STRATEGY, ONE ALWAYS ENDS UP WITH "IFP > 0" AFTER EACH CYCLE (WITHOUT SYMMETRY-DISBALANCE TO FORM ORBITS) 
   
(Let's finally claim "the hitting of a mathematical wall of D'Alambert strategy" as solvable in any informational dynamically_orbital_system);  
(Let's finally reiterate "an additional unit after a cycle" as a result in any informational dynamically_orbital_system and reaffirm the D'Alambert strategy effectiveness).  CQFD




 


• THE DOUBLE-HAKIZA-STRATEGY (OPTIONALLY COMBINED WITH AN INTENTIONAL FAVORABLE SYMMETRY-DISBALANCE) 


Let's first generalize the mutational  distribution  of Informational intensities "IIs"  for the isolated compressed reversal sequences representing the whole friction_flow of information in a geometrically gravitized natural order (clarifying the most wrongly overrated claims ever, yet the most believed and taught  by so many "the so-called first law about conservation and the so-called entropic second law with always an increasing disorder"...these are more worse than free will)...INTUMVA ZAMAHO, NDASUBIYEMWO... Such theoretical suppositions can never coexist with the practical law of large numbers and the principle of least action within a universe (built on symmetries) where everything is inevitably and unavoidably in a dynamically-orbital motion (some people have already been persecuted for calling out these overrated conservation and entropic pure-theoretical-special-cases in different ways...Who would have given a damn anyway... Except, whether you like it or not, with the MMB "money talks"... Run your own test and embrace the facts).

The necessary-alternating flag-chain [... H ... O ... H ...

MORE THAN 200 YEARS AGO

<<In his "Essai Philosophique sur les Probabilités", Laplace proposed that if a vast intellect ("Laplace's Demon") knew the exact position and momentum of every single particle in the universe at one moment, it could perfectly predict the entire past and future using the laws of classical mechanics, because the universe operates deterministically, with every event being a cause of the next. He stated this idea , suggesting that for such an intellect, "nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes">>.


MORE THAN 300 YEARS AGO

<<The Challenge: Newton could fully solve the two-body problem (e.g., a planet orbiting a star) using his laws of motion and gravity, yielding predictable elliptical orbits. He realized that with a third body, these orbits became chaotic and unpredictable.
In Principia (1687): He presented the problem in Book I, Proposition 66, focusing on geometric illustrations and textual descriptions rather than a complete mathematical solution, as one didn't exist>>.


AT THIS VERY MOMENT
                                                        
I, HAKIZIMANA BORN 14 APRIL 1995 IN KINAMA/BUJUMBURA/BURUNDI (THIRD SON OF HAKIZIMANA AND NIBIZI), HEREBY STATE:  
                           
<<Whatever the position and momentum of any stuff in the universe might be, the HAKIZA-TABLE tells at least both the past and the future of that stuff in question when it comes to the directions evolution of its motion; that said, the HAKIZA-TABLE may not be enough but still appeals to "Laplace's Demon">>.

<<Whatever a complete mathematical solution to the three-body problem might be, it must be in one way or another a combination involving three HAKIZA-CHAINs where each of them specifically indicates the evolving change in direction of its corresponding body in question; "still under development">>.

<<Whatever the angle from which one might choose to analyze  the mutational distribution table, the conclusion is more than obvious to appeal to the notion of super-determinism where "any large-scale structure of randomness is not random; it instead has an inevitable fixed, universal architecture">>. 



# Optional (but recommended for trading in real world)


Let's now create an intentional favorable symmetrical disbalance, since we have the full picture of the mutational distribution:

As already seen, there is a necessarily unshakable symmetry not only between informational intensities (frequency of occurrence) of isolated reversal sequences but also between informational total periods "TT" for all reversal sequences and their consequential non-reversal sequences; which goes like this:

      (90) /     ------    (90) \ 
      (45) /\    ------    (45) \/
      (35) /\    ------    (35) \/       ----> from respective non-compressed isolated reversal sequences with "T = even number = 2A" where A∈{2, 3,...} 
      (10) /\    ------    (10) \/       ----> from respective non-compressed isolated reversal sequences with "T = odd number = 3+2A" where A∈{1, 2,...}
    (22.5) /\/   ------  (22.5) \/\
     (7.5) /\/   ------   (7.5) \/\      ----> from respective non-compressed isolated reversal sequences with "T = odd number = 3+2A" where A∈{1, 2,...}
   --------------------------------   

        Totally Equivalent to: 

                                (90) /     ------    (90) \ 
                                (90) /\    ------    (90) \/
                                (30) /\/   ------    (30) \/\

                                ------------------------------
     
                           TT = [(90 * 1) + (90 * 2) + (30 * 3)] * 2 = 720 ==> 720 min for a time-frame "ST = 1min"
                           The consequential non-reversal sequences has an average symmetrical  informational total period "NTT = 720"
                           ==> The total time-duration TD = (720 + 720) ; meaning 1440 min of total time-duration for a time-frame "ST = 1min"


For instance, since it is obvious that there are 7.5 isolated reversal sequences starting with a red-candle (from the sum of 4.285714 and  3.214285 isolated reversal sequences with "T = 3+2A" where A∈{1, 2,...} as in the MUTATIONAL DISTRIBUTION TABLE [... H ... O ...] for isolated reversal sequences with "T = odd number greater than 3"  like \/\/\ and so on...), let's actually suppress each of those 7.5 isolated reversal sequences starting with a red-candle and with "T = 3+2A where A∈{1, 2,...}" by using the following conditions below:

- Whenever we have II(3) starting with red-candle, make sure the last informational partial potential is the sum of the two last consecutive informational partial potentials (make sure this is only applied on the "7.142857...85714285...% of all reversals representing the loosing or negative very small side but fatal one" of any possible long orbit) and keep scaling with one additional unit as if nothing happened.


- And whenever we have II(odd number greater than 1 or even number greater than 2), the informational final potential "IFP" for the rest of the sequence is nullified; since we made sure this is only applied on the "7.142857...85714285...% of all reversals representing the loosing or negative very small side but fatal one" of any possible long orbit, this creates in the long run a favorable-symmetry-disbalance.






# Prototype and Result

- We nullified in the process above an informational final potential IFP dynamically worth +45 (unit) from direct orbits:

Dynamically Worth +10 (unit) from "A" Pairs like \/ within isolated reversal sequences with "T = odd number greater than 3"  like \-1/-2\+3/0\0 etc... .
From precisely IFP = +5.714285 and IFP = +4.285714  as in the MUTATIONAL DISTRIBUTION TABLE [... H ... O ...].

Dynamically Worth +35 (unit) from "A" Pairs like \/ within isolated reversal sequences with "T = even number greater than 2"  like \-1/-2\+3/0  etc... .
From precisely IFP = +15 and IFP = +20   as in the MUTATIONAL DISTRIBUTION TABLE [... H ... O ...].


- We created in the process a disbalance for informational intensities by nullifying the informational final potential "IFP = 0" of 7.5 isolated reversal sequences with "T = 3+2A" where A∈{1, 2,...} :

22.5 isolated reversal sequences with "T = 3"  like \/\ and no more existing  7.5 isolated reversal sequences with "T = 3+2A" where A∈{1, 2,...}
But on the winning side, we still have 30 isolated reversal sequences with both "T = 3"  and  "T = 3+2A" where A∈{1, 2,...} .


In other words, we end up with:

    (90) /     ------    (90) \ 
    (90) /\    ------    (45) \/
    (30) /\/   ------    (22.5) \/\

   ---------------------------------

        Dynamically expressed as:

                                (90) /-(a)                   -----     (90) \+(b) 
                                (90) /+(a)\-(a-1)            - - -     (45) \-(b)/+(b+1)
                                (30) /+(a)\+(a-1)/+(a-1-1)   - - -     (22.5) \-(b)/-(b+1)\-(2b+1)

                                ----------------------------------------------------------------
                  
                                    The intentionally created favorable-symmetry-disbalance 
                                
                                
# N.B.: 

**The above symmetry-disbalance creation is optional, one may still come up with another own sounding way of creating intentionally a favorable-symmetry-disbalance by fetching from the 85.71428...85714285% (globally forming directly-linked orbits thanks to the advantages offered by the law of large numbers), a result of the geometrically gravitized linkages within the inseparable friction-flow of information (Described via the three THEOREMS OF THE PRESENT THEORY)**.                                

 

 

• THE PASSIVE-STRATEGY (COMBINATION OF THE DOUBLE-HAKIZA-STRATEGY AND THE FAVORABLE SYMMETRY-DISBALANCE) 

In order to be unbeatable, the passive-strategy combines the intentional created favorable symmetrical disbalance with the Double-Hakiza-strategy; and theoretically would generally look like this: 
  
E.g.:
    ...  \-1/-2\-3    /-4   \+5   /-4   \-5/+6   \-5/-6\+11/0\0    /+5\-4 ...   /+5\+4/+3  \+2   /-1   \+2   /+1\-1   /+1\+1/+1   \-1/+1  ...

    ...  \+1/+1\+1    /+1   \-1   /+1   \+1/-1   \+1/+1\-1/0\0     /-1\+1 ...   /-1\-1/-1  \-1   /+1   \-1   /-1\+2   /-1\-2/-3   \+4/-3  ...

N.B.: One must take into consideration some additional fees from brokers when it comes to trading (a small scale factor in real world might be needed)

    <<The most deranging question is now sorted out: "Yes, the single infinite reversal sequence can be an informational_mutation_structure">> 


# THE-PASSIVE-STRATEGY for trading in real world (script kept private... still undergoing a patent process... anyway, any crazy individual can still come up with an own idea combining the DOUBLE-HAKIZA-STRATEGY with any other of his/her own method to create an intentionally favorable  symmetry-disbalance using the "85.71428...85714285% of global directly-linked orbits" to cement "7.142857...85714285% from the positive side of a possible long orbit" and then use the later against the "7.142857...85714285% from the negative side of a possible long orbit").
 




# Final Note:


Therefore with 85.71428...8571428% globally forming directly-linked orbits (which means 617.1428571...8571428min out of 720min for the informational total period "TT" of isolated reversal sequences) capable to yield an informational final potential "IFP = +308.571428...8571428". 
Once combined with the Double_Hakiza_Strategy, it is more than enough to practically remedy the cited harsh conditions from just 51.42857min out of 720min representing the negative side of a given possible long orbit while the remaining 51.42857min out of 720min is for the positive side of the same given possible long orbit (for mutational computation, the "creation of an intentional favorable symmetry-disbalance" is just optional, but still it is recommended in order to remain profitable in trading using an affordable real-world small portfolio balance); consequently according to the actual theory:

 
BY REDUCING THE SO-CALLED NP HARD PROBLEM INTO A NP COMPLETE PROBLEM TO END UP WITH "IFP > 0" (AS EITHER IN NP CLASS "2"&"1" OR IN P PROBLEMS) 
        
(Let's finally claim "P = NP" as a possible and provable ultimate truth in any informational dynamically_orbital_system);
(Let's finally reiterate and reaffirm "P != NP" as a plausible ultimate truth in any informational statically_orbital_system).   CQFD
                                                                                                                                         



    



 








4. INTERPRETATION


* Informational Flow Principle

==> In any informational dynamically orbital system, the visible whole (information in real time) is created and lost within the invisible (information within imaginary time); it is a mutation (not just a simple flow of information or not just a simple transfer of physical quantities when it comes to mechanical systems) of which only the trigger of the movement decides its beginning, its magnitude and its end.




* Informational mutation laws

==> To well apprehend the informational mutation laws, one must have well understood in first place their counterparts same laws in the mechanical version of the UNIVERSAL MUTATION (It does not even worth my time to rewrite those same laws, for more details google and consult the HAKIZA-1). 


> Wins and Losses in any steps for both practical HAKIZA-METHODS, the unbeatable modified and enhanced either D'alambert or martingale-like-style  exactly appeals to the THIRD LAW  of the universal mechanical mutation (mutational singularity for any unit per orbit):

          « THE IMPOSSIBLE EXISTENCE =THE NOTHING = THE SECOND GOD »
                                                     
                            «  ]0, 1[ ∪ ]1 ,2[ »
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  














5. CONCLUSION 
 

As a matter of facts, "THE INFORMATIONAL MUTATION" is about geometrically gravitzing the notion of information (A.K.A Energy) by expressing bits of information as informational-mutation-structures and reduce them into  orbits of information (turns out this might be theoretically a very easy task for a ternary based processing hardware than a binary one, I personally wish I actually had one to practically prove myself right) then dynamically compute the obtained orbits of information and finally reinterpret the computed orbits into bits of information (with the NP hard sorted out).


To be much more clear, the notion of computation despite its vastness and complexity, still it does fundamentally appeal to a very simple notion of gear-box-transmission with an input and output ; it consequently does worth mentioning that "THE INFORMATIONAL MUTATION" (or its mechanical version "THE UNIVERSAL MUTATION") does satisfy the conditions of what most scientists call beyond any doubt "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING" due to its undeniably inevitable and unavoidable information-energy-equivalence-unifying-nature. 

Therefore,  Same as the EMM (Energy-maker-machine for the HAKIZA-1 mechanical version) unifying the infinitely large and small scales, so does the MMB (Money-maker-bot for the HAKIZA-1i informational version) since as described at the beginning "any beam of light or electrons moving near the speed of light are just a natural perfect orbit"; which therefore means both qubits (in quantum information) and classical bits  can be geometrically expressed and reduced into orbits; one can then dynamically compute the obtained orbits (compute the obtained symmetries in other words) of information and finally reinterpret the computed orbits into classical bits of information (with the NP hard sorted out).


--> We do dub such above unifying computing process "THE MUTATIONAL COMPUTATION" (N.B.: The mutational computation is too vast and is being developed and tested  separately from the present general fundamental description of the informational-mutation-theory and can only be actually accessed by THE "FDNB = FORCE NATIONAL DE DEFENSE DU BURUNDI" upon demand). 



**Whenever you have the law of large numbers, the flow of information is gravitized, the notions of entropy and conservation are clarified**

# Here below is the Gravitized informational joke to calculate people's madness (More you know, more crazier you look like...some would say...But even if Newton would had known how to calculate the madness human-beings, Still he could not had exploited it during his time without the nowadays information-technology and required electronic tools, meaning the MMB isn't about one person being a so-said genius so far, it is about the whole humanity evolving and contributing intellectually in one way or another):

**Because you don’t need luck in any so-said chaotic informational system... hahaha... the only way to calculate people's madness is to geometrically gravitize that same madness in question via the informational mutation axioms and theorems (can be applied to the whole universe, MURAKOZE CANE).**
