# REQUIREMENT

(Open the informational-mutation-theory file  with any of your browsers in order to have a good view of the content in a "Raw-format" )








# HAKIZA-Template


The HAKIZA-Template is required to well comprehend the INFORMATIONAL-MUTATION-THEORY.
**For smart-phones, watch the youtube video below**.

**For PC, download the HAKIZA-Template from GitHub and apply it in MT5**.

          https://github.com/hakiza1/Informational-mutation/blob/main/HAKIZA-1i.tpl



**Step 1: Download the HAKIZA-Template from GitHub**

1.  Go to the GitHub repository page where the template (the `HAKIZA-1i.tpl` file) is stored.
2.  Click on the `HAKIZA-1i.tpl` file to view it.
3.  On the top right of the file content box, you will see a **"Raw"** button. Right-click on the **"Raw"** button and select **"Save link as..."**.
    *   *Why "Raw"?* This ensures you download the actual file and not a GitHub webpage.
4.  Choose a location you can easily find, like your **Desktop**, and click **"Save"**.

**Step 2: Locate Your MT5 Templates Folder**

Just like before, you need to find where MT5 stores its templates.

1.  In your MT5 platform, go to **File** > **Open Data Folder**.
2.  Navigate to **MQL5** > **Profiles** > **Templates**.

**Step 3: Copy the Downloaded Template**

1.  Go to your Desktop (or wherever you saved the downloaded `HAKIZA-1i.tpl` file).
2.  **Copy** the file.
3.  Go back to the **Templates** folder you opened in Step 2.
4.  **Paste** the `HAKIZA-1i.tpl` file into this folder.

**Step 4: Apply the Template to Your Chart**

1.  Go back to your MT5 platform and open the **chart** where you want to load the template (e.g., EURUSD M5).
2.  Right-click on the chart.
3.  Hover over **"Template"**.
4.  You will now see the name of the template you just downloaded in the list. Click on it.
5.  MT5 will instantly apply all the indicators, their settings, and any saved graphical objects from the template to your current chart.

**You're all set! The HAKIZA-Template is now active on your chart.**












# WARNING



ANYONE would be absolutely right to point that out! **The law of large numbers is indeed universal and points beyond any doubt to the so-called grand unifying final-theory or simply "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING"** - and that's precisely what makes the present theory so compelling and potentially devastating to conventional thinking.

**The Brutal Truth The Present Theory Exposes**

**The Law of Large Numbers Doesn't Care About Our Theories**
- Free will? "Just an illusion" in short term
- Entropy? "Just a statistical artifact" in small samples
- Efficient markets? "Just a Myth" that collapses at large scale  
- P ≠ NP? "Just a context-dependent limitation"
- Information (A.K.A energy) conservation? "just for static systems" mathematically theoretical and physically non-existent in real world always in motion

The present theory essentially says: "Stop over-complicating stuff with mathematical decorations- the universe runs on super-predetermined large number statistics, and everything else is just noise".
And guess what ? Out of chaos, always comes order in the long run (not actually disorder as wrongly assumed and believed by so many).
